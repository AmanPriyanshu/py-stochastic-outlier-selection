# py-stochastic-outlier-selection
Stochastic Outlier Selection (SOS) is an unsupervised outlier selection algorithm. It uses the concept of affinity to compute an outlier probability for each data point.

For more information about SOS, see the technical report: J.H.M. Janssens, F. Huszar, E.O. Postma, and H.J. van den Herik. Stochastic Outlier Selection. Technical Report TiCC TR 2012-001, Tilburg University, Tilburg, the Netherlands, 2012.
